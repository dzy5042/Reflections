 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    This is set-up for version control for a project. I am indicating what need to be tracked by git.

 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

 	It works as a commit-ready template, and it gives more flexibility for user to control commit.
