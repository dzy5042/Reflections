How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    Help me quickly find out what is changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    I may need to trace back after some trials.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    I may forget to commit sometimes, but I have more control on which version I just commit for.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is created for programming project base.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use gid log to find out commit id and apply diff command.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    I always have right to undo with version control.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Some personal project code.
